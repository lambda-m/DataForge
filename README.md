# DataForge

DataForge is a tool for generating data for testing and development purposes. It can currently only generate a set of csv files which describe an imaginery but realistic dataset describing a VMware vsphere environment at a typical enterprise scale.

## Usage

```bash
python3 generate-vsphere.py
```

This will generate a set of csv files in the `vsphere-data` directory.
